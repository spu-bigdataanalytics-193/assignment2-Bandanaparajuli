This assignment aims to our help our collegue John by doing his two tasks
1. to reduce the time supposed to download images from imgur
2. to resize the images

To do this assignment 
I created the imgur client id which is required to download the images. Using the client id i used jones code to download the images which took me longer time . Using my own code to minimize the time which took less than the johns code.

Again, for resizing, John's code to resize images took longer time as it is CPU bound process and it is suggested to use multiprocessing to reduce the time.
